# naves.dev Website

I am currently in the process of developing a website. The website is still in its early stages, and I am still determining the best approach to take.

Next Steps: I am considering removing the "Posts" tab and replacing it with a "Blog" or similar feature. Additionally, I plan to enhance the website's visual appeal and professional appearance.

Good other info
