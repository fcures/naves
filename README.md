# naves.dev Website Description

The website is still in its early stages, and I am still determining the best approach to take.

Next Steps: Add a date to every posts json when generated and gotten from the html. And add a sorting method in the posts searching so itcan be sorted by most recent and old. I don't want to turn it into a blog so I will probably figure out something AI related or delete the site after I get something good.
